No information is uploaded to servers, no logs are created remotely, and no third parties ever see the sensitive content.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Traditional online decryption tools require users to transmit encrypted data to a server for processing. This introduces multiple risks: interception during transfer, storage on remote systems, potential breaches, or even deliberate logging by service providers. Even with encryption in transit, the server must temporarily hold the plaintext after decryption.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The hybrid scanner eliminates these risks through zero-knowledge design. The cryptographic operations run exclusively on the user's device using widely trusted open-source libraries. The master key never leaves the browser environment, and the reconstructed ciphertext is processed and discarded immediately after producing the result.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">The Privacy Advantage</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Local processing means true end-to-end confidentiality. Whether handling medical information, financial details, legal documents, or personal credentials, users retain full control over their data at every step. There is no possibility of server-side compromise affecting past or future scans.</p> <h3 class="svelte-led0iy">Key Privacy Benefits</h3> <ul class="svelte-led0iy"><li class="svelte-led0iy">No data transmission to external servers</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">No remote storage or logging of content</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Immediate memory cleanup after decryption</li> <li class="svelte-led0iy">Works offline once page is loaded</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-led0iy">Compliance and Trust</h3> <p class="svelte-led0iy">This approach aligns naturally with strict privacy regulations and organizational policies that prohibit sending sensitive data outside controlled environments. Users can verify the open-source nature of the implementation, providing transparency that cloud-based alternatives rarely match.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Even in untrusted network conditions, such as public Wi-Fi, the security remains intact because nothing meaningful travels over the connection. Only the static web application is downloaded initially.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Does the scanner work without internet after loading?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Yes. Once the page loads, all functionality operates offline since decryption happens locally.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Are any analytics or usage data collected?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">No identifying or content-related data is transmitted. The tool operates with complete privacy.</p></details> <details class="svelte-led0iy"><summary class="svelte-led0iy">Can organizations host their own version?</summary> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Absolutely.
