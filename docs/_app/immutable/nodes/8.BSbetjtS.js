This feature allows users to decrypt several secrets in sequence without restarting the scanning process each time.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">When batch mode is enabled, the scanner collects all successfully decrypted messages in a list rather than replacing the previous result. Users can set a target number of scans, and the system will automatically pause once that count is reached, preventing accidental over-scanning.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">The workflow begins with activating batch mode and optionally specifying the desired number of items. Scanning then proceeds normally: each valid hybrid pair presented to the camera adds its decrypted secret to the growing collection. Progress is visible in real time.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Effective Batch Strategies</h2> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Preparation is key for smooth batch operations. Organizing physical documents in sequence reduces handling time between scans. Good lighting and consistent camera distance help maintain reliable detection throughout the session.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1li990r">Practical Tips</h3> <ul class="svelte-1li990r"><li class="svelte-1li990r">Set realistic target counts based on document volume</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Use export features mid-session if needed</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Pause and resume without losing collected results</li> <li class="svelte-1li990r">Review all items before final export</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-1li990r">Mid-Session Management</h3> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Even before reaching the target or completing the batch, users can copy individual results or export the entire current collection as a text file. This flexibility supports workflows where partial results need immediate use or verification.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Batch mode maintains the same high security standards as single scanning, with all decryption occurring locally and no data transmitted externally.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Does batch mode affect scanning speed?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">No. Detection and decryption performance remains identical to single mode.</p></details> <details class="svelte-1li990r"><summary class="svelte-1li990r">Can I change the target count during scanning?</summary> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Yes.
