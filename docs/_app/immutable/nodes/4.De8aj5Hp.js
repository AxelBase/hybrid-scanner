Instead of storing sensitive information in a single scannable code, the system deliberately splits the encrypted payload across both mediums, ensuring that neither code alone contains usable data.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">This split-secret design begins with strong encryption of the original message using AES in CBC mode. A random salt is generated and used both as the initialization vector and for key strengthening through PBKDF2. The resulting ciphertext is then divided into two parts: the first segment is embedded in the QR code along with the salt, while the second segment is encoded into a Code 128 barcode.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">The physical separation creates a powerful security advantage. Even if someone photographs or copies one of the codes, they gain nothing meaningful without the other half. This makes casual interception or unauthorized duplication effectively useless.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Why This Design Improves Security</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Traditional single-code systems concentrate all risk in one carrier. If a QR code containing private information is captured, the data may be compromised immediately. The hybrid method distributes risk across two independent visual elements that must be present simultaneously for successful decryption.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Key Security Benefits</h3> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Requires physical access to both codes at once</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">No meaningful data revealed from partial capture</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Resistant to remote scanning attacks</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Maintains confidentiality even if one code is shared</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Real-World Applications</h3> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">This approach works well for secure document exchange, access credentials, medical records, financial instructions, or any scenario where sensitive information must be transferred physically with minimal risk. The dual-code requirement acts as a natural access control mechanism.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-1tq17n3"><summary class="svelte-1tq17n3">Can the scanner work with only one code visible?</summary> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">No. Both the QR code and barcode must be in the camera frame for decryption to occur.
