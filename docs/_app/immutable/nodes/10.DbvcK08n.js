Whether working with single scans or batch collections, users can copy individual items or export everything with ease while maintaining control over sensitive data.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Each decrypted secret appears with dedicated controls. The copy button transfers the specific result to the device clipboard for immediate use, while the download option saves it as a plain text file. File names follow a clear pattern to support organization.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">In batch mode with multiple results, additional collective actions become available. Users can copy all current secrets as a single block or download the entire collection in one text file, perfect for importing into other systems or archiving.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">Secure Handling Practices</h2> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Since decryption occurs locally, exported data remains under user control from the moment it is created. Text files contain only the plaintext results without additional metadata, minimizing exposure.</p> <h3 class="svelte-jo8es1">Export Options</h3> <ul class="svelte-jo8es1"><li class="svelte-jo8es1">Individual copy for quick pasting</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Individual download as numbered text file</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Batch copy all to clipboard</li> <li class="svelte-jo8es1">Batch download all as single file</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-jo8es1">Best Practices After Export</h3> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">Once results are exported, consider clearing the browser session if working in shared environments. The scanner does not persist data between sessions, providing automatic cleanup when the page is closed.</p> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">For sensitive workflows, users can export immediately after each successful scan or wait until the complete batch finishes, depending on operational needs. The flexibility supports various security postures.</p> <h2 class="svelte-jo8es1">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-jo8es1"><summary class="svelte-jo8es1">Are exported files encrypted?</summary> <p class="svelte-jo8es1">No. They contain plaintext results.
